# What is SportToken?

SportToken is a sports prediction platform and user‑run marketplace. Users can bet on official games or create their own markets. Our core exchange, SportTokenExchange, removes the sportsbook edge by pricing both sides directly from a shared liquidity pool — delivering fair odds, instant fills, and protected liquidity for LPs.

## Key Points

- Fair odds (de‑juiced from traditional lines)
- Instant fills from an internal liquidity pool
- Share‑based LP accounting with risk caps
- Build your own markets (self‑create) and stream community events
