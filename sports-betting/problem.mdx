Two dominant paths exist today:

1. **Traditional sportsbooks** embed a spread (the "vig") in every line. Pricing is tilted in the operatorâ€™s favor.
2. **Orderbooks** fragment liquidity across price ticks; takers must cross the spread and face thin depth, fewer markets, and no parlays/props.

SportTokenExchange removes the operator spread and aggregates liquidity in a single pool so takers receive fair, instant fills.
