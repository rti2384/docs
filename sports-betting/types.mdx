### 1. MoneyLine

In a moneyline you are simply picking who will outright win the matchup.

### 2. Spreads

In our Spread Markets we set a line for the game. For football a line may be -2.5 for Team A. If you choose this selection you are betting that Team A will win by more than 2.5 points. Alternatively if you choose Team B on this market, which will show as +2.5, you are betting that Team B will not lose by more than 2.5 points.

### 3. Totals

In our Totals Market we set a line for the game. For football a line may be 45.5 points. You can choose to bet the over if you think more than 45.5 points will be scored in the game in total. Under if you believe less than 45.5 points will be scored in the game in total.

### 4.  Player Props
