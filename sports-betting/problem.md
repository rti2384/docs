# What Problem Do We Solve?

1. Traditional sportsbooks embed a spread (the “vig”) in every line; pricing is tilted in the operator’s favor.
2. Orderbooks fragment liquidity across price ticks; takers must cross the spread and face thin depth, fewer markets, and no parlays.

SportTokenExchange removes the operator spread and aggregates liquidity in a single pool so takers receive fair, instant fills.
