- If A is −300 (price 0.75) and B is \+300 (price 0.25): a \$300 bet on A receives 400 A‑shares at 0.75. The pool holds 400 B‑shares (\$100 liability) to balance.
- Later a \$50 bet on B at 0.25 buys 200 B‑shares, reducing B inventory.
- If B moves to 0.30 and a user requests 400 B‑shares (\$120) but only 200 are available, the pool sells 200, then acquires A to complete the order.
