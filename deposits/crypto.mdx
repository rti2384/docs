You can also send your funds directly on the blockchain. 

Send USDC to your unique deposit address. Funds are swept into your SportToken balance once confirmations are detected.

## Steps

1. Select Add Funds and then select "Recieve funds"

2. Copy your deposit address (Polygon USDC native).

3. From your exchange or wallet, send **USDC (native) on Polygon** to that address.

4. Our monitor detects confirmations and sweeps funds into your account (typically \< 5 minutes).

5. Your balance updates in the header / Wallet panel.

### Notes

- Only **USDC native on Polygon** is supported for this method.

- If you send the wrong asset or on the wrong chain there is nothing we can do to help

- For very large transfers, splitting the amount into a few transactions can be safer per exchange guidance.
