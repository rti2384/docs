Buy USDC with Visa/Mastercard or bank rails via MoonPay. USDC lands in your SportToken wallet after MoonPay completes the transfer.

## Steps

1. In-app: Deposit → **Buy USDC** (MoonPay).
2. Enter the amount; complete KYC if MoonPay prompts.
3. Complete payment. MoonPay transfers USDC on-chain to your wallet.
4. Funds appear once MoonPay’s on-chain transfer confirms.

### Notes

- Limits and KYC are controlled by MoonPay. Availability varies by region.
- If payment succeeded but USDC hasn’t arrived, check MoonPay status email and contact MoonPay support with your reference number.

### Fees and Timing

- Card/bank fees are shown in MoonPay’s checkout.
- USDC typically arrives within minutes after MoonPay confirms on-chain.
