Withdraw USDC from your SportToken wallet to any wallet you control.

## Steps

1. Wallet → **Withdraw** → paste your receiving address (\*\*Polygon USDC\*\*).
2. Enter the amount → confirm.
3. The transaction is submitted on-chain; you’ll see a confirmation in-app.

## Timing & Fees

- Polygon gas is minimal; most withdrawals settle in \< 30 seconds.

### Notes

- To cash out to fiat, send to an exchange (e.g., Coinbase) and sell to your bank.
- If you need help moving to a different chain, contact support with your destination chain and address.
