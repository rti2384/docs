# V1 Betting Model (for SCM)

Self‑create markets currently use the V1 escrow‑based model (similar to our props flow):

1. Creator posts terms and escrows their stake.
2. Takers accept (fixed) or bid (auction) the counter stake.
3. Market locks on acceptance; settlement occurs after the event with proofs.

V2 pool‑based pricing will be introduced for SCM in a future upgrade.
